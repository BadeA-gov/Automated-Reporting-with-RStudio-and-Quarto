# Automated-Reporting-with-RStudio-and-Quarto
Workshop for NYC NED AFS. Files walk through how to automate reporting/visualization workflows. Learning goals are: 1) Understanding how to write custom functions and source them, 2) the basics of how to make a report in Quarto and 3) combining 1 and 2 to develop automated reports.

Files include:
Automated Reporting in R: the Quarto document that Andrew Bade is presenting.
expanded_reporting_data: example data used for demonstration.
Writing Functions: all of the functions and testing from Part 1.
my_functions: a source file of user-generated functions.
Waterbody Survey Report A: a basic Quarto report.
Waterbody Survey Report B: a parameterized Quarto report.
Driver Script: an R scrapt that batch-generates reports.
